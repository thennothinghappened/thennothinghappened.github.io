                <h1>GameMaker Studio 2 (introduction)</h1>
                <p>
                    Not gonna lie, GMS 2 is probably the best thing that I have decided to buy
                    to date. I have got endless hours of enjoyment from this program, despite only
                    having owned it for a short time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Quite honestly, I took a 'break' from programming for quite a while before
                    getting this software, I really didn't feel like I was getting much out of it
                    other than making small things to show to friends occasionally. That all changed
                    when I got GMS 2, a little over a month as of writing. Since then, I've produced
                    over 30 little projects just because of how fun it is to program for me.
                </p>

                    Surrounding this little info blurb you'll see some of my creations which were
                    'good enough' that I could bother to give them a HTML export. Have fun. (right now just slimeform but I swear I'll add more)

                        This is definitely my most playable and feature-rich game. It is also
                        the first one I made in the engine. This game has random level generation,
                        a functional level editor which can save and load from files, and pretty
                        nice feeling movement if I do say so.
                    </p>

                        I wanted to put a HTML5 browser link here but GameMaker wasn't cooperating (html5 in gm sucks) so instead please download. Some time later
                        on I intend to get it working, mainly it is just the level editor which isn't cooperating.
