						<p>
							As the name suggests, <a href="https://github.com/thennothinghappened/pelorus">Pelorus</a>
							is a client for the <a href="https://compass.education">Compass</a> LMS service.
						</p>

						<p>
							The initial drive of the project was to hopefully bring most of the important functionality
							into a proper native app for Android, and additionally, desktop. Compass has a lot of issues,
							and the mobile app especially is particularly plagued with them.
						</p>

						<p>
							The other main drive for the project was of course, just to learn! Pelorus was made entirely
							with unfamiliar tooling, and the majority of the work was done over the course of a few weeks
							in the 2023 January holidays.
						</p>

						<p>
							While the codebase could really do with improvements, the end result was a much faster and less
							buggy app than the official offering, and overall, I'm pretty happy with it given that!

						<p>
							<a href="https://github.com/thennothinghappened/kotlass">Kotlass</a>
							was my first introduction to the Kotlin programming language - as with
							Pelorus, it also suffers from some pretty bad programming practices, but once again,
							it gets the job done, and being my first time in the Java ecosystem, and in dealing
							with any sort of API client - it's alright.
						</p>

						<p>
							I do plan to, when time allows, rewrite both of these two from the ground up, given

							There isn't a huge amount to say about this one - moreso an entry to fill in space,

							remotely complicated HTML (that I'm aware of) available for Multiplatform.

							My solution was to create <a href="https://github.com/thennothinghappened/htmltext">HtmlText</a>,

							<i>What is <a href="https://github.com/thennothinghappened/JNIX">JNIX</a>?</i>
							Good question, hypothetical person!
						</p>

						<p>
							<i>JNIX</i>, to summarise, is an abomination under construction - or rather, my attempt
							to create a minature subset of a <i>*NIX-like</i> OS under JavaScript, by using Web Workers.
						</p>

						<p>
							Without yet having a working build, the project has gone through multiple total rewrites,
							and now ships with a <q>compiler</q>, if you could call it that - to turn ES6 modules into
							single runnable files in its own format - to give you an idea how bad this is.
						</p>

						<p>
							I hope to again have time to work on it, purely for the fun of it. Making it requires learning
							a whole lot about how the underlying systems behind computers work, and that's fun!

					<section class="content">

						<p>
							As the blurb summarises, <a href="https://github.com/thennothinghappened/gml-web/">gml-web</a>
							is a little project I threw together a while back, with the goal of imitating ExpressJS's
							way of setting up a web server.
						</p>

						<p>
							It turned out alright, given my lack of experience, and follows the same architecture as the
							JS library it was based off.
						</p>

						<p>
							This project is actually an extension of my earlier <a href="https://github.com/thennothinghappened/gamemaker-http-server">gamemaker-http-server</a>,
							which was far more limited in scope, had several glaring security issues (not to say this doesn't!), and was far buggier.

					<section class="content">

						<p>
							<a href="https://github.com/thennothinghappened/win7site">AeroWin</a>
							was my first attempt at making something that resembled an OS in the browser.
						</p>

						<p>
							It originally started out as trying to imitate the Windows 7 style UI, but moved onto
							incorporating actual applications, and a filesystem (by way of <code>localStorage</code>).
						</p>

						<p>
							I intended to take it further - started work on user-written app support, but hit a wall
							with multitasking: JS being a singlethreaded language, it would be pretty similar to early
							systems, where either one app at a time gets to do work, or implementing cooperative
							multitasking - where apps have to give control back to the system when they're done.
						</p>

						<p>
							I wasn't happy with these compromises, so the project stopped. Much later, from this, JNIX
							emerged, as a second go, with a full, <q><i>real</i></q> system!
