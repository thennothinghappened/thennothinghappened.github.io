						<p>
							As the name suggests, <a href="https://github.com/thennothinghappened/pelorus">Pelorus</a>
							is a client for the <a href="https://compass.education">Compass</a> LMS service.
						</p>

						<p>
							The initial drive of the project was to hopefully bring most of the important functionality
							into a proper native app for Android, and additionally, desktop. Compass has a lot of issues,
							and the mobile app especially is particularly plagued with them.
						</p>

						<p>
							The other main drive for the project was of course, just to learn! Pelorus was made entirely
							with unfamiliar tooling, and the majority of the work was done over the course of a few weeks
							in the 2023 January holidays.
						</p>

						<p>
							While the codebase could really do with improvements, the end result was a much faster and less
							buggy app than the official offering, and overall, I'm pretty happy with it given that!

							<a href="https://github.com/thennothinghappened/kotlass">Kotlass</a>

							it gets the job done, and being my first time in the Java ecosystem, and in dealing
							with any sort of API client - it's alright.
						</p>
						<p>
							I do plan to, when time allows, rewrite both of these two from the ground up, given

						<h1>GMEdit-Constructor</h1>
						<a href="https://github.com/thennothinghappened/GMEdit-Constructor"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
					</header>

					<span class="blurb">A GMEdit extension for compiling straight from the editor.</span>

					<section class="content">
						<p>
							Thanks to the rate of progress in recent years by the team at YoYo Games, the old methods of
							compiling from outside of the IDE been effectively obsoleted by a proper command-line tool
							for managing runtimes. This tool is far from perfect, but GMEdit's popular plugin
							<a href="https://github.com/YAL-GMEdit/builder">builder</a>, which directly invoked the
							compiler, hasn't been able to keep up with the rate of changes.
						</p>
						<p>
							Due to this, I took on making a replacement which uses YYG's new toolchain, and hopes to
							offer a lot more polish and functionality, while being a more maintainable codebase.
						</p>
						<p>
							Constructor is a bit of an anomaly as far as GMEdit plugins go, as it does everything a bit
							weird - I'm personally a huge fan of being able to use modern language features, and jumped
							straight into the deep end by taping together an ad-hoc way to use ES modules, type
							definitions, among others, whilst still working within the constraints of GMEdit's now quite
							old structure.
						</p>
						<p>
							In future, I'm hoping to extend support to GMRT's new toolchain, which exists separately
							from the current one - I believe that doing so would be set GMEdit up to "make it" into the
							modern age of GM which sits over the horizon, which it has so far had trouble keeping up
							with in the transitional period in between.

					<section class="content">
						<p>
							There isn't a huge amount to say about this one - moreso an entry to fill in space,
							but at the time of writing Pelorus, there wasn't any library capable of rendering any
							remotely complicated HTML (that I'm aware of) available for Multiplatform.

							My solution was to create <a href="https://github.com/thennothinghappened/htmltext">HtmlText</a>,

							<i>What is <a href="https://github.com/thennothinghappened/JNIX">JNIX</a>?</i>
							Good question, hypothetical person!

							<i>JNIX</i>, to summarise, is an abomination under construction - or rather, my attempt
							to create a minature subset of a <i>*NIX-like</i> OS under JavaScript, by using Web Workers.
						</p>
						<p>
							Without yet having a working build, the project has gone through multiple total rewrites,
							and now ships with a <q>compiler</q>, if you could call it that - to turn ES6 modules into
							single runnable files in its own format - to give you an idea how bad this is.
						</p>
						<p>
							I hope to again have time to work on it, purely for the fun of it. Making it requires learning

					<section class="content">
						<p>
							As the blurb summarises, <a href="https://github.com/thennothinghappened/gml-web/">gml-web</a>
							is a little project I threw together a while back, with the goal of imitating ExpressJS's
							way of setting up a web server.
						</p>
						<p>
							It turned out alright, given my lack of experience, and follows the same architecture as the
							JS library it was based off.
						</p>
						<p>
							This project is actually an extension of my earlier <a href="https://github.com/thennothinghappened/gamemaker-http-server">gamemaker-http-server</a>,
							which was far more limited in scope, had several glaring security issues (not to say this doesn't!), and was far buggier.

					<section class="content">
						<p>
							<a href="https://github.com/thennothinghappened/win7site">AeroWin</a>
							was my first attempt at making something that resembled an OS in the browser.
						</p>
						<p>
							It originally started out as trying to imitate the Windows 7 style UI, but moved onto
							incorporating actual applications, and a filesystem (by way of <code>localStorage</code>).
						</p>
						<p>
							I intended to take it further - started work on user-written app support, but hit a wall
							with multitasking: JS being a singlethreaded language, it would be pretty similar to early
							systems, where either one app at a time gets to do work, or implementing cooperative
							multitasking - where apps have to give control back to the system when they're done.
						</p>
						<p>
							I wasn't happy with these compromises, so the project stopped. Much later, from this, JNIX
							emerged, as a second go, with a full, <q><i>real</i></q> system!

						<h1>This website</h1>

					<span class="blurb">Winner for most generic website ever!</span>

					<section class="content">
						<p>
							If you're wondering <em>why</em> the site looks so generic, the answer is simple: I had a
							school project due <em>very</em> soon (i.e., two days remaining), and was way more
							interested in working on JNIX at the time.
						</p>
						<p>
							Since JNIX wasn't in any usable state (and never really went anywhere in the end), I hastily
							put together a submission that'd tick all the necessary boxes for the assignment. An
							interesting aside from this is that I used a design tool (figma) to work out the layout
							ahead of time, whereas my previous approach had always been "just work until it looks good
							enough!".
						</p>
						<p>
							In contrast, the approach of making a mock-up first ended up being a great idea, since it
							was now just a job of re-creating the design I already had in mind, in the actual medium -
							unsurprisingly, this meant the bulk of the project was done within a few hours, and from
							there I tinkered with some homebrew single-page application code (also new to me at the
							time!)
						</p>
						<p>
							Since I've not had any direct motivation since then to make something better, and this
							technically works as a personal site, it hasn't changed a whole lot since then besides a
							deal of tinkering in the background to make it more friendly to screen readers and whatnot.
